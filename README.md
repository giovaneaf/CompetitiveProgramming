Some solutions for some problems ^^

I didn't mentioned sorting algorithms in my solutions, if you don't know what sorting is
you can check here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/

Believe me, you can do sortings with O(n*log(n)) time complexity

You can use STL's sort function which is O(n*log(n))
